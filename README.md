# Learn-JSModules

This project is a learning repository for JavaScript modules, both CommonJS Modules and ES6 Modules. It also includes TypeScript projects using both CommonJS Modules and ES6 Modules to show how the configurations and project setup differs in those circumstances.

## Project Layout

This is a mono-repository containing several different projects. Each project is self-contained and designed to demonstrate a particular project setup.

These are the included projects:
* CommonJSModules
* ES6Modules
* TS_CommonJSModules
* TS_ES6Modules

### CommonJSModules

Demonstrates how CommonJS modules are used to export functions from one file and use them in another file.

### ES6Modules

Demonstrates how ES6 modules are used to export functions from one file and use them in another file.

### TS_CommonJSModules

Shows how TypeScript projects can use CommonJS modules.

### TS_ES6Modules

Shows how TypeScript projects can use ES6 modules.
